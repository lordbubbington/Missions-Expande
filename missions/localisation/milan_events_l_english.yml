 milan_events_event.1.d:0 "During the middle of the night, courtsmen still loyal to the family of Visconti stormed your bed chambers in the middle of the night. An ambitious remote relative of the long gone Filippo Maria Visconti took it upon himself to restore the Visconti family to the throne. You and your loyal advisors were thrown into the dungeons while they placed the young duke on the throne."
