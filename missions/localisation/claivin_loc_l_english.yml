 PRO_churches_title: "Restore the Churches" 
 PRO_churches_desc: "The 12th century saw a great deal of new churches and cathederals in the Provence Proper. These buildings were made in a style mimicking the glory of Roman archiecture; nowadays they have grown old and no longer shine as they once did. With the resurgence of ancient knowledge, now is a perfect time to reinvigorate them."
 
 PRO_france_friend_title: "Strengthen Ties with [FRA.Monarch.GetName]"
 PRO_france_friend_desc: "Even since the days of the Carolingians, the Counts of Provence were in very close proximity to France, both policitally and geographically. In 1237, Count of Provence, Ramon Berenguer IV, married his daughter off to King Louis IX of France. In these precarious days, it would do us well to cement this relationship with France and the Angevin Dynasty."
 pro_not_hre.tooltip: "Has NOT completed mission §YMend Ties with the Holy Roman Empire§!"
 
 PRO_hre_friend_title: "Mend Ties with the Holy Roman Empire"
 PRO_hre_friend_desc: "Perhaps persuing a close relationship with France in the past and severing our status as a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire was a bit rash.

 PRO_annex_lorraine_desc: "The time has come to make our realms one!"
 
 PRO_holyland_title: "The King of Jerusalem"
 PRO_holyland_desc: "Though many have claimed the title 'King of Jerusalem,' few have been able to actually press that claim. Will the claims of the Good King pass into the annals of history, or will we make history itself?"
 
 PRO_naples_title: "The King of Naples"
 PRO_naples_desc: "Though his brother was recognized King of Naples, René of Anjou ascended to the throne when the brother died before succeeding the claim. The title was quickly snatched from us by the King of Aragon - however it is never too late to take it back."
 
 PRO_aragon_title: "The King of Aragon"
 PRO_aragon_desc: "The claims of René of Anjou passed mostly into obscurity in the midst of the Catalan Civil War. The justification does exist though..."

 PRO_france_claim_title: "The King of France"

 BUR_challenge_hre_desc: "The Dukes of Burgundy have long been at odds with it's neighbors even since the days of Middle Francia.
