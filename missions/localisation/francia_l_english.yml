 FRX_idea_1: "The Capitularies"
 FRX_idea_1_desc: "The Capitularies were a series of laws and edicts passed by the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties. They varied vastly in content and purpose, but were ultimately highly effective in facilitating the administrative roles necessary to upkeep such an expansive realm."
 
 FRX_idea_2: "Repel the Saracens"
 FRX_idea_2_desc: "In 721, the Umayyad invasion was halted by the Frankish victory at the Battle of Toulouse, guaranteeing the soverignty of Christendom for centuries to come. The threat of saracen incursion has once again appeared, though this time in the the East. We must rally the men to once again step up to become the bulwark of Christianity"
 
 FRX_idea_3: "Lessons of Charlemagne"
 FRX_idea_3_desc: "Under Chalemagne, the Frankish Empire found great military sucess on several fronts. This was in part due to the Carolingian strategy of emphasizing mobility and encouraging looting to buy the loyality of his nobles. It has long since been the days of yore, but mobility and looting remain remarkably essential on the battlefield."
 
 FRX_idea_4: "Frankish Cavalry"
 FRX_idea_4_desc: "Frankish cavalry remained a formidable force in their time, not due to battlefield prowess in particular, but due to their great manuverability. But we must ask: 'why not have both?'"
 
 FRX_idea_5: "Gallo-Roman Legacy"
 FRX_idea_5_desc: "As successors to both the greatness of Rome and also to the Gallic tribes, we inherit the industriousness of the Romans and the hardiness of the Gauls, among many others. Let us not forget our roots."
 
 FRX_idea_6: "Modern Succession Practice"
 FRX_idea_6_desc: "Though we claim the heritage of Francia, we are no longer obligated to entertain the custom of partible inheritance. We can now have a more sensible rule of succession."
 
 FRX_idea_7: "New Frankish Renaissance"
 FRX_idea_7_desc: "The rule of the Carolingians brought with it a flourishing of arts and literature within the Frankish Empire. History once again repeats itself; the stability of the Empire and the prosperity of its domain brings with it a new flourshing of culture. The zeitgeist of the Rebirth permeates society, and can be felt down to the lowliest peasant."
