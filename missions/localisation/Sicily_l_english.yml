 sicily_government:0 "Sicilian Monarchy"
 sicily_government_desc:0 "Well, this was not expected, but it just may work to our advantage. It seems a group of ruffians called 'The Mafia' have taken up a position in our society, and are challenging the normal citizenry. Rather than risk a civil war, we should let it play it's course."
 sicily_government_option1:0 "We shall keep a careful eye on the situation."
 two_sicily:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies"
 two_sicily_desc:0 "The Sicilian legacy has been one we are very proud of. We now emblazen it in history for forever with a title worthy of our glory, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies! May the Island of Sicily, Island of Malta, and the Kingdom of Naples always know where there loyalties lie!"
 sicily_government_option2:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies has risen!"
 sic_sar:0 "An offer they can't refuse..."
 sic_sar_desc:0 "Oh, they never saw it coming, didn’t they? Our coffers were stocked, spies riddled through their government, a binding royal marriage, our army ready to fight, navy set for transporting our troops with armed escorts, forts and barracks throughout our land to support us. There is no way they could have resisted us when our envoy waltzed into the capital and presented the King of Aragon a claim on Sardinia. After moving to a more, shall we say, secluded place to retire, our diplomat explained the true nature of the situation to Aragon. Spies assassinating Aragon’s government the minute they fight back if they resist an armed invasion upon Aragon’s refusal, for a war Aragon isn’t prepared to fight in the first place; all the while the “above the table” route is oh-so conveniently laid out for them to take; with minimal issues of course. Of course as they say in Aragon, the king is but a wise man; and there is truth in those words. By the end of the day Aragon had signed over Sardinia and our envoy was returning to Sicily. As soon as they arrived, King $Ruler$ sailed to Rome, and our dear friend the Pope finalized our, say, rightful acquisition, and made the Kingdom of Sardinia ours and placed them as a lower partner in a Royal Union. Other nations in Europe, even those of the Slavs in the far east of our continents domain, were shocked at how suddenly we acquired this quaint little territory so quickly and easily, right out of the blue. It seems to me they have forgotten the ways of the forbearing Roman Crown of which there rule of their kingdoms descends from. None the less, Sardinia is ours. "
 sicily_government_option3:0 "Now that Sardinia is ours, it is time to look to the west..."
 sic_pap:0 "Petition to the Pope"
 sic_pap_desc:0 "The Pope is an excelent man, of course, the leader of the Christian world. The king of Aragon, however, isn't so much of a nice guy. We have been a bit irritated at the antics of the King of Aragon, and leaving them is the right decision. We asked the Pope to grant us back our soverigenty, citing reasons why Aragons treatment of us is not in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ. While the Pope didn't excommunicate the King of Aragon, he did grant us our sovereignty."

 sicgov_decision_desc:0 "It seems there is turmoil in our nation, it would be wise to find a solution. Maybe we should start by letting our citizens voice there opinions. We normally don't do that, being a monarchy and all, but our newfound status isn't going to be around just because a paper says so if our people are upset."
 request_independence_title:0 "Request Independence"
 request_independence_desc:0 "It is a little known fact in Europe that the Pope will grant sovereignty to a nation if the appeal to him is just right. We have longed for our freedom for many years now, let's see what we can do to persuade the Pope of our position."
 extortion_plot_title:0 "The Extortion of Sardinia"
 extortion_plot_desc:0 "It would be next to impossible for us to expand out into the world, being a nation comprised of two islands in the Mediteranian. However, if we are to 'persuade' a neighboring kingdom to see eye-to-eye with us on some of our more, 'lucrative oppertunities', we might be able to get a leg-up in the region."
 tunisian_assets_title:0 "Tunisian Assets"

 nation_of_islands_title:0 "Stones in the Pond"
 nation_of_islands_desc:0 "Now that we have reclaimed all parts of our domain from every extent we had, it is time to take our ambitions further.

 labor_force_sic:0 "Merchants and Traders"
 labor_force_sic_desc:0 "Our nation is but an island. Between our ports, and the ports of south Italy, we provide rest to those sailing along the trade routes.

 friend_of_the_sailors_sic:0 "Friend of the Sailors"
 friend_of_the_sailors_sic_desc:0 "There are many sailors from foreign ports who fear that the places they go will lead them to having issues abroad. Different cultures, different laws, different religions, all causing issues when a sailor comes in.

By treating foreigners well in this respect, it will make us seem friendlier when we work diplomatically with foreign governments."
 sicilian_marines_tse:0 "Sicilian Marines"
 sicilian_marines_tse_desc:0 "As an island, our military has two ways to engage in battle, either on a shoreline, or on land. Also since we are an island, it makes it all the more difficult for us to either make an offensive, or take the defensive. By training a new type of solider, marines, we can form military units that can defend our nation from invaders, make landings on enemy shores, and compliment our ships with men for boarding parties and performing other naval-related tasks."

 naval_guard_program_sic:0 "Naval Guard Program"

 private_investment_tsc:0 "Private Sector Investment"
 private_investment_tsc_desc:0 "The private sector has always had the ability to invest in our economy, gaining favor with us without hurting our own pockets.

 mare_nostrum_tse:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 mare_nostrum_tse_desc:0 "Now that we control every strategic port and island in the Mediteranian, we can service our navy at the blink of an eye. All of our troops can be stationed across our empire to defend it without being subjected to being cut off of supplies. We have about as much influence over shipping as the Habsburgs do over European politics."
 the_gift_of_empire_tse:0 "The Gift of Empire"

 naval_service_tse_desc:0 "Like we have delt with before with our nation, being an island is quite problematic. Fielding a navy can only go as far as the sailors we have; and a man in the navy can't be a man in the army, and vice versa. By streamlining supurfulous roles on ships, and putting in a draft system for sailors, we can quickly keep our navy afloat longer and better than before."
